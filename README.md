ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shanis!

I'm a Frontend Developer on a quest to finding my next big job opportunity!
with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Node.js, MongoDB and a few others under my belt, I've been enjoying growing in my profession, and look forward to further learning. Even though I'm still a young dev, I enjoy helping out newer dev's because I understand and remember the struggle of starting out as self-taught.

I'm currently learning React, while there are a lot I would like to learn, I feel like this will benefit both myself and my new employer!

I love working on projects that make an impact, or projects that bring happiness, passion, or nostalgia!
I'm always thinking about clean manageable code for the future of developers and the ever changing tech standards.

If you'd like to collaborate on anything, I'm open to help!
